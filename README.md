# Script Hub

A script hub.
If you want to, you can [Open an issue](https://github.com/RealPacket/My-Scripts/issues/new) to suggest one, and if I see your issue, I'll add it to [this project](https://github.com/users/RealPacket/projects/1), which lists things that I should do.

Games:
   - How Far can You Fly,
   - Break In Story
   - and Some Clicker/Tapping games.

AC Disablers:
  - Only Seal Secure right now (you have to re-execute it when you die).
