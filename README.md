        <b><br>If you want to request me to make a script, make a new issue (I aim for games that don't have ACs (except seal secure because it has shit protection) as I don't want to go there right now, and I want to not have protected games {e.g. games with remote spy protection so it is easy to call a event instead of getting gibberish for a event name}), if your Game suggestion meets the requirements, make a issue and I will add it to [My Script TODO List](https://github.com/users/RealPacket/projects/1)</b>
   - Some Clicker/Tapping games
      - Yes
      
      
      
      - Exploit Section
          - AC Disablers
            - Only Seal Secure Right now (you have to re-execute it when you die because then it starts making its scripts with math.random name).
