# FAQ

This contains things that are commonly asked
(or I think might be asked).

## Can I use something in my project?

**Only** if it's licensed under AGPL.
So, if you **don't** have it, you can copy the [**LICENSE**](LICENSE) file,
**or** from <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt> into your repo/source code folder.

## Why are you using GPL/AGPL?

<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>

> Which license is best for a given library is a matter of strategy, and it depends on the details of the situation.
>
> At present, most GNU libraries are covered by the Lesser GPL, and that means
>
> we are using only one of these two strategies, neglecting the other.
> So we are now seeking more libraries to release under the ordinary GPL.
>
> Proprietary software developers have the advantage of money;
> free software developers need to make advantages for each other.
> Using the ordinary GPL for a library gives free software developers an advantage over proprietary developers:
> **a library that they *can* use, while proprietary developers *can't* use it.**
>
> Using the ordinary GPL is not advantageous for every library.
> There are reasons that can make it better to use the Lesser GPL in certain cases.
> The most common case is when a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software
> through other libraries.
> In that case, the library cannot give free software any particular advantage,
> so it is better to use the Lesser GPL for that library.
> This is why we used the Lesser GPL for the GNU C library.
> After all, there are plenty of other C libraries;
> using the GPL for ours would have driven proprietary software developers to use another.
> No problem for them, only for us.
> **However**, when a library provides a significant unique capability,
> **like GNU Readline**, that's **a horse of a different color**.
> The Readline library implements **input editing and history** for interactive programs,
> and **that's a facility not generally available elsewhere**.
> **Releasing it under the GPL and limiting its use to free programs gives our community a real boost.**
> At least one application program is free software today specifically because that was necessary for using Readline.
> If we amass a collection of powerful GPL-covered libraries that have no parallel available
> to proprietary software,
> they will provide a range of useful modules to serve as building blocks in new free programs.
> This will be a significant advantage for further free software development,
> and some projects will decide to make software free in order to use these libraries.
> University projects can easily be influenced;
> nowadays, as companies begin to consider making software free,
> even some commercial projects can be influenced in this way.
> Proprietary software developers, seeking to deny the free competition an important advantage,
> will try to convince authors not to contribute libraries to the GPL-covered collection.
> For example, they may appeal to the ego,
> promising “more users for this library” if we let them use the code in proprietary software products.
> Popularity is tempting, and it is easy for a library developer to rationalize the idea
> that boosting the popularity of that one library is what the community needs above all.
> But we **shouldn't** listen to these temptations,
> because we can **achieve much more** if we **stand together**.
> We free software developers **should** **support one another**.
> **By releasing libraries that are limited to free software only,**
> **we can help each other's free software packages outdo the proprietary counterparts**.
> **The whole free software movement will have more popularity,**
> **because free software as a whole will stack up better against the competition.**
